# toyota-lexus-sales
This is the final project for a course called Visualization and Persuasion. Our task was to persuade the upper level management that the strategy for Toyota and Lexus is doing the job or not with data and visuals. We had to use Tableau for analysis and answered the questions below by articulating how, why, or why not. We had to choose 3 models from Toyota and 3 models from Lexus, in order to make a comparison they have to be compatible models. (i.e A Lexus suv with a Toyota suv.) We were also allowed get additional data from the Internet. The questions we had to answer are below:
1.	Are there seasonal factors, if so what are they? Do Toyota and Lexus take advantage of them?
2.	What is happening in December? What are the low and the high? In a year and the whole data range? Explain.
3.	How do certain models behave in Toyota and Lexus?
4.	 How does the new year in a model affect the sales?
5.	Are incentives effective in increasing the sales? Are they incentive compatible? Explain.
6.	How are the national events such as COVID 19 affect the sales?
7.	What are the relationship between the hybrid and traditional vehicles?
8.	What are the Toyota and Lexus strategies in US? Is there a relationship between them? How has it changed over the years?
9.	Try to forecast the sales for the year in 2022 and 2023. (Tableau has a FORECAST button.)

The data provided was not tidy, so lots of data wrangling was needed to do the analysis in Tableau.
Below is a peek at the initial data file.
